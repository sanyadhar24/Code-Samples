# Assignment 2: Experiments with 10 models for GDP growth prediction to deal with problem of inflation of GDP growth

# Assignment 8: Structural time series analysis on macroeconomic data (dynamic factor with principal components, ARIMA, and state space model). Using breakdates to detect structural change in a linear regression model. 

#  Data Task: Analyzing and visualizing trends in racial and educational wealth gap using survey data 

# Data Cleaning and Analysis Example: Cleaning and merging data on schools and financial aid, subsetted to Tennessee. Added summary statistics and created unique categories for schools.

# HW 8: Data manipulation and analysis with test score data. Create confidence intervals for test score data and dataset on schizophrenic incidence among monozygotic twins. Two Monte Carlo Simulations: 1. simulates random selection of 4 cokes from a set of 8 and estimates probability of more than 3 diet cokes selected 2. simulates process of randomly selecting four colors and counts number of trials required to select all four at least once
